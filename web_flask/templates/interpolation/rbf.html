    <h1>Radial basis function</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Radial basis function (RBF) interpolation</strong> is an advanced method in approximation theory for constructing high-order accurate interpolants of unstructured data, possibly in high-dimensional spaces. The interpolant takes the form of a weighted sum of radial basis functions, like for example Gaussian distributions. RBF interpolation is a mesh-free method, meaning the nodes (points in the domain) need not lie on a structured grid, and does not require the formation of a mesh. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_interpolation">Wikipedia</a>
